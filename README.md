The "ft_printf" project is an implementation of the printf function in C. The printf function is a standard library function that is used to print formatted output to the console or other output devices.

## Features
The "ft_printf" function includes many of the features of the standard printf function, including the ability to format output using various specifiers and flags. Some of the key features of the function include:

- Support for various data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, and strings.
- Customizable formatting options, including precision, field width, and justification.
- Support for various flags, including the '#' flag for hexadecimal and octal output, the '0' flag for zero padding, and the '-' flag for left justification.
- Error handling for invalid format strings.
## Usage
To use the "ft_printf" function, you must include the "ft_printf.h" header file in your C program and link with the "libftprintf.a" static library file. You can then call the "ft_printf" function as you would the standard printf function, passing in a format string and any arguments to be printed.

The format string specifies the output format and can include various specifiers and flags to customize the output. For example, the "%d" specifier is used to print an integer, while the "%s" specifier is used to print a string. Flags can be used to specify options such as field width and justification.

## Conclusion
The "ft_printf" project provides a useful implementation of the printf function in C, with many of the features of the standard library function. By including the "ft_printf.h" header file and linking with the "libftprintf.a" static library file, you can use the "ft_printf" function in your C programs to print formatted output to the console or other output devices.
